## Routes

### Authentication
| Method | URI               | Action |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| POST   | /register        | Register a user |
| POST   | /login           | Authenticate user |
| POST   | /logout          | Logout user |

### Blog Posts
| Method | URI              | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| GET    | /posts          | View all posts |
| GET    | /posts/{id}     | View single post |
| POST   | /posts          | Create a new post |
| PUT    | /posts/{id}     | Update a post |
| DELETE | /posts/{id}     | Delete a post |

### Comments

|--------|----------------------|--------|
| POST   | /posts/{id}/comments | Add a comment to a post |
| DELETE | /comments/{id}       | Delete a comment |

## Middleware & Policies
- **Auth Middleware**: Ensures only authenticated users can create, edit, and delete posts/comments.
- **Post Policy**: Restricts editing and deleting to the postâ€™s author.
- **Comment Policy**: Allows only the author of a comment to delete it.

## Deployment
1. Set up a production environment (e.g., DigitalOcean, AWS, or shared hosting).
2. Configure the database and update `.env` accordingly.
3. Run migrations:
   ```sh
   php artisan migrate --force
   ```
4. Set up a queue worker for email notifications (optional):
   ```sh
   php artisan queue:work
   ```
5. Use a process manager like Supervisor to keep the queue worker running.

## Conclusion
This Laravel blog application provides a simple foundation for a blog with user authentication, posts, and comments. Further improvements can include image uploads, tagging, search functionality, and more.
