# Laravel Blog Project

This is a simple blog application built with Laravel. It allows users to create, update, and delete posts, as well as leave comments on posts. The project includes user authentication, post management, and comment features.


## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- PHP >= 8.4.0
- Composer
- MySQL
- Laravel 12

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miclemabasie/Laravel-Blog.git
   cd Laravel-Blog
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install Laravel's PHP dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Generate the application key:**
   Laravel requires an application key for encryption purposes. Generate it by running:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Set up the database:**
   Update the `.env` file with your database credentials:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

6. **Run migrations to set up the database tables:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Seed the database (optional, for test data):**
   You can seed the database with some sample data by running:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```
